🔍 Features
	•	Intelligent filtering of profanity, explicit or morally problematic terms.
	•	Multi-lingual support with modular NLP pipelines.
	•	Trauma-sensitive mode: avoids potentially triggering words or suggests alternatives.
	•	Corpus-based clean text generation (coming soon).
	•	Easy to extend with your own moral / ethical dictionaries.

 🌱 Why CleanWriter?

Because modern NLP tools often repeat the most statistically common — not necessarily the most healthy or respectful — language.
CleanWriter helps you keep your writing (or your users’ input) clean, respectful, and mentally safer.
